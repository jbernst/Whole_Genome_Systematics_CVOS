# Whole_Genome_Systematics_CVOS
This repository contains pipelines and analyses for disentangling conflicting evolutionary histories from whole genomes using _Crotalus_ rattlesnakes. 

## Data and Sampling
Whole genome data can be found on the [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under Projects PRJNA1150930 and PRJNA1137891. Specific sampling information can also be found on the SRA, or in [Supplementary Table S1](Supplemental_Tables).

## Code and Analyses
This project (accepted in _Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution_) involves a suite of analyses for identifying biological processes that are correlated with alternative topologies in systematic efforts. A README file for **all** analyses in bash is provided in the README_CVOS-Phylo_2025.1.29.md file. This will contain a tutorial for the analytical workflow for the entire project.
